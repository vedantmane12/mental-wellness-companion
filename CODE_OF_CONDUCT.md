We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our Mental Wellness Companion project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, with special consideration for the sensitive nature of mental health technology.

* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community
* Prioritizing user safety and wellbeing in all contributions
* Respecting the privacy and confidentiality of mental health discussions

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Special Considerations for Mental Health Technology

Given the sensitive nature of this project:

### Safety First
* All code contributions must prioritize user safety
* Never implement features that could provide harmful advice
* Report any potential safety issues immediately
* Test thoroughly before deployment, especially safety features

### Privacy and Confidentiality
* Never share or discuss real user data or conversations
* Use only synthetic data for testing and development
* Respect the privacy of all community members
* Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA where applicable)

### Ethical Development
* Consider the ethical implications of all features
* Avoid reinforcing biases or stereotypes about mental health
* Ensure inclusive design for all user groups
* Maintain transparency about AI limitations

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
