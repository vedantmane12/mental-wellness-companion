# Mental Wellness Companion ðŸ§ 

An innovative RL-powered mental wellness support system that uses GPT-4o-mini for user simulation and learns optimal conversation strategies through reinforcement learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project implements a Mental Wellness Companion that learns to provide personalized mental health support through:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: PPO for conversation flow, Contextual Bandits for recommendations
- **LLM-in-the-Loop Training**: Novel approach using GPT-4o-mini for realistic user simulation
- **Multi-Agent System**: Orchestrated agents for conversation, recommendations, and monitoring
- **Safety-First Design**: Built-in crisis detection and ethical constraints
